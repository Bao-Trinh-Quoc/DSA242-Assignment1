done ArrayList. <--- now try to understand the code better.

DeleteUserData: 
A function pointer to a custom function for deleting user data, 
useful when the elements are pointers to dynamically allocated objects.

itemEqual: 
A function pointer to a custom function for comparing elements,
useful when the default comparison is not appropriate.


XArrayList<Point*> pointList(deletePoint, comparePoints); <--- ohhhhhh


begin to implement DLinkedList
