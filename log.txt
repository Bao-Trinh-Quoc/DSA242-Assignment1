done ArrayList. <--- now try to understand the code better.

DeleteUserData: 
A function pointer to a custom function for deleting user data, 
useful when the elements are pointers to dynamically allocated objects.

itemEqual: 
A function pointer to a custom function for comparing elements,
useful when the default comparison is not appropriate.


XArrayList<Point*> pointList(deletePoint, comparePoints); <--- ohhhhhh

I have some proposed changes in clear().
design wise now clear() will remove even dummy nodes.
not yet apply to this src code tho.

i probably will start code some of 1D list functions today. but man
i got lab to do

Lets start 1D list functions
rightnow i will implement 1D list using XArrayList, there is no clear
answer which to use tho. just use what i think is good for this. 
will fix later if needed.

there is something like this in inventoryManager
 Note: You should implement this method with O(n2) time complexity to fully passed all
 the testcase.

implement constructor for 1D
